# Machine Learning

This repository explores Machine Learning through projects, scripts, and tutorials.  
It covers **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **deployment** using frameworks like **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch**.  
Applications include **classification**, **regression**, **NLP**, and **deep learning**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- `data/` : raw and processed datasets (`.csv`, ...)
- `dataset` : data use to do supervise machine learning(apprentissage supervise) (`.parquet` etc)
- `scripts/` : Python scripts for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- `notebooks/` : Jupyter/Colab notebooks with tutorials and experiments
- `models/` : trained models (pickle, h5, or pt formats
- `mlruns/` : MLflow tracking for experiments
- `service.py` : deployment script (API or service)
- `settings.py` : project configuration
